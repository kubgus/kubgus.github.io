# @kubgus on GitHub!

Hey, my name is Kubo and I'm a web developer.
I work with HTML, CSS and Javascript with various APIs.

## My current work:
### Remify:
- Remify is a learning app supposed to make studying easier
- It works by making everything into cards that can be pinned, marked and shared
- Users can create learning groups where they can share homework and other tasks with each other
- It's a webapp made with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase API connected to a Firestore Database to handle all the data

Remify is currently work-in-progress so it's not availible just yet.

## My previous work:
- [Speed Read](https://github.com/kubgus/Speed-Read) - This project was inspired by a YouTube video that showcased how fast a person can read without having to move their eyes.
- [Simple Planet Generator](https://github.com/kubgus/Planet-Generator) - I created this project when I wanted to try something new. It could be done better but it was mainly for the sake of fun so I don't care 

## Other projects:
- Monez - Monez is an unreleased Discord economy bot that I made with the Discord.js API. I'm hope to be able to return to this project sometime in the future.
